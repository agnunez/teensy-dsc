The TeensyDSC Dew Heater Controller is a 4 channel dew heater controller with active temperature monitoring.  Each channel uses a MOSFET for variable power in 10% increments and has a manual override.  We also support remote temperature sensors so that we dynamically change the power as the air temperature drops/stabilizes to use the least amount of power necessary.
